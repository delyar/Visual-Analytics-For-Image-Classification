- URL to deployed webpage: https://interactive-gilt.vercel.app/
- Optional comment: Got the idea of lines 65 to 69 of the App.svelte file from the previous projects. I creted the top axis part with d3.js. however, when I am using vercel for deployment, the d3 axis is not showing. In order to see that it is working the project should be ran with npm run dev command locally.
